## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Very simple one-page application made with JavaScript and some TailwindCSS for initial design. The project was initially developed to learn the very basics of JavaScript and was made from a tutorial by [LearnWebCode](https://www.youtube.com/user/LearnWebCode). He has a really nice YouTube channel with lots of useful videos so I'd recommend you check him out. The project is still in progress, but I can tell that I already like it. Hopefully everything will go smooth and I will catch on some core concepts of JavaScript.
